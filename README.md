# LD41 - ThinkBeforeEscape

A realtime-turn-based platformer. 

The player has a certain amount of time to advance in each turn, but when the turn is over, the enemies have their turn to move. You must watch out for this in order to advance in the game.

There is no penalty for loosing in the game, other than that the position of the player is reseted to the start of the current screen.

Can be played with keyboard (arrow keys and space) or with xbox gamepad (recomended).

Create for Ludum Dare 41.
